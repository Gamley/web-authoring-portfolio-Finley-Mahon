                        creature. VM got all of the staff at ANHIHUMAN INC. infected 
                        with The Roots. His mental state is very unstable. VM was considered 
                        a failed test do to how bad his infection was. The Lavender 
                        flower has shown up in both music videos that VM has appeared in.
